Next, let's look at Octant by VMware. Octant toes the line between being a desktop application and a web interface, in that you install it locally on your desktop, and it launches a server that gives you access to your cluster using your web browser. It uses your local kubeconfig to provide access to your clusters. Hence, there is no additional configuration required, and you can set up the kubeconfig in a server and have Octant installed on it, then serve it using a simple Nginx server. However, it is impossible to restrict access based on roles since the application was not designed for it. Specifically, Octant is designed to manage Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters, which are preconfigured enterprise-grade clusters provided by VMware.

Octant provides all the features of tools such as Headlamp & Lens, except this has a high focus on development. While the other tools are mainly designed to be used by DevOps teams, Octant comes with inbuilt support for debugging and plug-ins over gRPC which are designed to be used by development teams testing out their software in Kubernetes clusters.
