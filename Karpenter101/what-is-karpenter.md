# Karpenter

Before we dig into what Karpenter is, let's take a look at a common problem you can face with commercial Kubernetes architecture. Let's assume that your organization runs several microservices, each with a different amount of resource requirements. For example, the main microservices that act as the external facing API endpoints in your system will likely face a large number of requests per second and therefore require large amounts of CPU & memory requirements. Meanwhile, the microservices that do calculations in the background can use large amounts of CPU, but not huge amounts of memory. During peak times, the number of calculations made as well as the number of requests could be so large as to warrant extra large machines, whereas in the middle of the night outside of business hours, the resource requirements could be a fraction of the costs at peak hours. So, how do you provision resources while taking all this into consideration?
