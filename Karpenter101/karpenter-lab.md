# Karpenter Lab

## Requirements

Before we start, you need to have a simple EKS cluster. Using `eksctl` is the fastest way to get everything up and running, so look through the [relevant section](../EKS101/what-is-eks.md) and run the `create cluster` command. If you are going to be creating the cluster manually, make sure that it runs the latest EKS version possible. Once you create the cluster, make it a point to go into the plugins section and add all the necessary plugins (VPC CNI, kube proxy, cluster autoscaler). The cluster autoscaler will be removed later in favor of Karpenter, but let's have some form of infrastructure scaling available now. As for the nodegroup, you can create a single nodegroup with a single node that runs a t3 small machine. Karpenter will be changing all of this later. You will also need to set up the IAM master & nodegroup roles accordingly.

Setting up Karpenter has a number of steps since you have to basically give Karpenter access to your cluster, nodegroups, cluster resources, etc... We
